      <h5>Why React Query?</h5>
      <p>
        In this demo you will be able to see how React Query is a significant
        improvement over <strong>redux</strong>, <strong>mobx</strong>, and
        any other general-purpose state container.
      </p>
      <p>
        No reducers, thunks, or sagas. No ES6 models to maintain in order to
        tag them as observable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simply associate a key with your fetch call and let{" "}
        <strong>React Query</strong> handle the rest.
