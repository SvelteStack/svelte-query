# This package has been migrated to the [TanStack Query](https://github.com/TanStack/query/tree/main/packages/svelte-query) repo. 
You can install it with npm install `@tanstack/svelte-query`

## Upgrading to TanStack

It's easy to migrate your existing application over to tanstack from this package ✨

```bash 
npm uninstall @sveltestack/svelte-query
npm install @tanstack/svelte-query
```

Replace the following import: 
`@sveltestack/svelte-query` -> `@tanstack/svelte-query`

Rename the following functions:

`useQuery` -> `createQuery`

`useQueries` -> `createQueries`

`useMutation` -> `createMutation`

Finally, as of v4, queryKey needs to be an Array:
 
If you are using a string like `repoData`, please change it to an Array, e.g. `['repoData']`
